# Bout-time
The game involves users taking Tv series and seeing if they can put them in the correct chronological order. A single round of play consists of ordering four/five or six random TV series (depending on the level of difficulty choosen), and there are six rounds in each full game.
- Created a plist with all the TV series
- Created a countdown timer to give users 60 seconds to correctly order the series. When the timer expires, the series orders are checked for correctness
- If a user completes the ordering in less than 60 secsonds, they should be able to shake the device in order to get the order checked immediately
- Created logic to re-order the Tv series using the up and down buttons
- Created a method to determine whether or not the events were ordered correctly. Points should only be awarded for fully correct solutions
-  At the end of each round, the users can tap on a series and be presented with a SafariViewController which will show a web page (such as Wikipedia) with related information.
